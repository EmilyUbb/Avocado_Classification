## Classifying Organic and Conventional Types of Avocados and Predicting the Average Price
Emily Ubbelode

### Need: 
With the growing popularity of avocado toast I want to build a model that classifies if an avocado is organic or conventional. From there I plan to then build a regression model that predicts the average price of the avocado. This would be a useful tool for potential avocado farmers, to help them discern which types of avocados they wish to grow. Additionally the Hass Avocado Board could use this data to persuade farmers to grow more of the type of avocado with the highest demand for each region. 

### Data:
Data on Avocado sales for both conventional and organic avocados was gathered from the Hass Avocado Board. I am using data from 2018 - 2021, collected weekly by region.

### Tools: 
EDA using Pandas
Build a classification and regression model using SK Learn


### MVP Goal

Have a well tuned classification model for determining if an avocado is organic or conventional.
